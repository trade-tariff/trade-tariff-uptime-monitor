# trade-tariff-uptime-monitor

Monitors the availability and response time of OTT service URLs, alerting via PagerDuty on sustained failures.

An EventBridge rule triggers a checker Lambda every minute. It probes each configured URL and publishes two CloudWatch metrics per endpoint (`Availability` and `ResponseTime`) to the `TradeTariff/Uptime` namespace. CloudWatch alarms fire after three consecutive failures and forward to a PagerDuty Lambda via SNS, which calls the PagerDuty Events API v2. Alarms auto-resolve when the endpoint recovers. A CloudWatch dashboard provides a live view of availability and response time history per endpoint.

## Architecture

```
EventBridge (rate 1 min)
  └─> Checker Lambda
        └─> CloudWatch Metrics (TradeTariff/Uptime)
              └─> CloudWatch Alarm (3 consecutive failures)
                    └─> SNS Topic
                          └─> PagerDuty Lambda (Events API v2 trigger/resolve)
```

## Adding URLs to monitor

Edit `environments/<environment>.tfvars` and add an entry to `monitored_urls`:

```hcl
monitored_urls = {
  "find-commodity"    = "https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/find_commodity"
  "search-commodity"  = "https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/search"
}
```

Each entry automatically gets its own CloudWatch alarm, metric stream, and dashboard widget. Push to deploy.

## Configuring PagerDuty

After the first deploy, populate the routing key from your PagerDuty service's Events API v2 integration:

```sh
aws secretsmanager put-secret-value \
  --region eu-west-2 \
  --secret-id trade-tariff-uptime-pagerduty-<environment> \
  --secret-string '{"routing_key":"<your-integration-key>"}'
```

Then redeploy so the new value is injected into the Lambda environment.

The routing key is required. A deploy without `PAGERDUTY_ROUTING_KEY` set fails
before it reaches AWS, and a pagerduty Lambda invoked without one raises rather
than returning successfully without paging anyone. Alarm on the pagerduty
function's `Errors` metric so a key that goes missing after deploy is visible.

## Deployments

Deployments are triggered automatically via GitHub Actions:

| Event | Environment |
|---|---|
| Push to any non-`main` branch | Development |
| Push to `main` | Staging and Production |

To deploy manually, load AWS credentials for the target account and run:

```sh
make deploy-development
make deploy-staging
make deploy-production
```

You can also run `make plan STAGE=<environment>` to preview changes without applying them.
